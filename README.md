## Welcome!

This repo I have created is a place for me to consolidate all my ICP's for CSE 5590/ CS 490 at UMKC. 
The goal is to make submissions easier without developing individual repos for my assignments. So I will add previous ICP's to
the repo, as well as continue to add new ones to this repo. 

## ICP 1,2,3,4

These ICP's haven't been added yet, as my focus is currently on ICP 5, 6, & 7. 

## In-Class Programming 5:

ICP 5 is...

## In-Class Programming 6:

ICP 6 contains two applications, a Restaurant/Venue Search dependent upon the Four Square API found at https://api.foursquare.com/
The other application is a recipe search based off of...

## In-Class Programming 7:
 ICP 7 is a MEAN stack application titled Library Management System. The goal of the application is to build something that will be a front end for a database that will store the data of "Books", while the application itself modifies the entries within the database.
 
 ## In-Class Programming 8:
 ICP 8 is an Android application that moves between two pages. One, a login page, the other a logout page. In it's basic form, the application rotates between the two. 
 
 ## In-Class Programming 9:
 ICP 9 is a Pizza Ordering app that takes advantage of Email intents, and Android system applications. It also passes information between intents, for multiple pages to have access to the same data that the _User_ has entered.
 ## In-Class Programming 10:

 ## In-Class Programming 11:

 ## In-Class Programming 12:
 Contains two applications, both oriented towards learning Databases. The first, is a SQLite Database application, with two user types:
 - Employeers
 - Employees
 Both types contain data that can be created, mutated, and destroyed. Since the data is a SQLite database, the data is stored locally on the device.
 
 The second, is a Firebase application, where the data is stored remotely, alongside using Firebase's more advanced user authentication features, alongside using the said features to allow us to have a User be deleted, and signed in/out of the application.
