# Recipe-Search

## Welcome
This is an application using the Edamam api to search for recipes. 
You have the functionality to search for recipes using the search bar. After pressing enter - or clicking the 
"Search." button, it will use your keyword entry and search for recipes that contain that word within
their titles. 

The application will return an array of items (up to 10) with relevant information. You can view the 
calories of the recipe, the nutrients of the recipe (Protein, Carbs, Sugars, Fat), as well as the
number of servings that the recipe can provide. 

When you click on the recipe's title, then it will take you to the site where you can pull up the 
actual instructions and ingredients for the recipe.
