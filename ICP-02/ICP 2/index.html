<p>Welcome to my web page. While I don't really have a whole lot to say, I do know of a few great scholarly words from my
 World History textbook.</p>
<div style = "font-family: Damascus,serif"><h4>The Samurai and the Kamakura Shogunate, 1185-1333</h4>
<h6>What were the causes and consequences of military rule in Japan?</h6>
<p>The gradual rise of a warrior elite over the course of the <span style="color: red;font-weight: bold">Heian</span> period finally brought an end to the domination of the Fujiwaras
    and other Heian aristocratic families . In 1156 civil war broke out between the Taira and Minamoto warrior clans based
    in western and eastern Japan, respectively. Both clans relied on skilled warriors, later called samurai, who were rapidly
    becoming a new social class.</p>
<p style = "font-style: italic">A <span style = "color: red; font-weight: bold">samurai</span> and his lord had a double bond: in return for the samurai's loyalty and service, the olrd granted him land or income.
    From 1159 to 1181 a Taira named Kiyomori dominated te the court, taking the position of prime minister and marrying his daughter
    to the emperor. his relatives became governors of more than thirty provinces. Still, the Minamoto clan managed to defeat the Taira,
    and the Minamoto leader, Yoritomo, became <b>Shogun</b>, or general-in-chief.</p>
