# In Class Programming 4
CS 490 Web and Mobile Programming Assignment 4

# Tasks:
## Task 1:
**Hover Image** Look at Image 1 and Image 2 from the lesson plan for reference. When the user's mouse hovers 
on the image, it should change the background of the empty frame with the relevant images and text.
For example: when the mouse hovered on the first image, it should change the contents (both the
background-image and the text) of the empty frame to that of the image hovered, and the descriptive
text for such image. 

 **Note:** We have provided a basic HTML and CSS code - you will need to write the JavaScript code.
 
 ## Task 2:
 **GitHub User Finder** Create an app which makes the call to the GitHub API (https://api.github.com/) and display's the following user's
 account details when searched by **username**. 
 * Name of the user.
 * The ID of the user.
 * Profile picture.
 * Link to the user's account.
 
 **Note:** There is no limit on details and creativity. You can add as many details as you can and 
 create an attractive and interactive web page.

 ## Summary
 While for Task one, I'm rather happy with how it turned out: Task 2 is a slightly different story.
 I had spent a little too much time trying to figure out exactly how the API would return data, 
 that I overthought how to do it. Rather, it wound up being quite simple. I'm also not particularly
 pleased with the design of the web page of Task 2, it's at least passable. The UI is usable, and
 easily understood.
